        <h1>Nexus 5X/6P Bootloop Fix</h1>

        <h2>Android modding community to the rescue!</h2>
        <p>
            The Android modding community has created a workaround for the bootloop issue common to the LG Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P that leaves the phone endlessly rebootingâ€”effectively useless and dead. I successfully used this method to resurrect my Nexus 5X after it went into the so-called Bootloop of Death. It has been functioning perfectly for over a month now, and hasn't had any random reboots like it used to (presumably due to the overheating issue). Check out the workaround on the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-5x/general/untested-nexus-5x-bootloop-death-fix-t3641199" target="_blank" class="link">XDA Forums</a>.

            Not only does my phone work again, but it actually works better! My battery lasts at least 33% longer! This is probably mostly due to me flashing the EX kernel instead of the stock kernel. It could also be because the phone is using 2 less CPU cores. Now I always have plenty of battery left at the end of the day!
