            <p>
                I'm a designer, developer, and user experience activist. I love making the Web a better place by creating fast, easy-to-use apps and sites, with designs that are both elegant and functional. I also enjoy sharing <a href="posts.html" class="link">my ideas</a> and <a href="/code.html" class="link">my</a> <a href="/design.html" class="link">work</a>. <a href="mailto:{{$ __Pep.michael.publicEmail $}}" class="link">Send me an email!</a>
                <br><br>
                In my spare time I like to read, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/mwilliaams" class="link">listen to music</a>, dance, play guitar, and explore the great outdoors.

                I live in sunny San Diego and know of only two seasons: "Warm" and "Hot".
