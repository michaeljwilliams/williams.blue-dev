                Hi! I'm a designer, developer, and user experience activist. I love making the Web a better place by creating easy-to-use, fast websites with designs that are both elegant and functional. I also enjoy sharing <a href="posts.html">my ideas</a> and <a href="work.html">my work</a>. <a href="mailto:{{$ __Pep.michael.publicEmail $}}">Send me an email!</a>
                <br><br>
                In my spare time I like to read, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/mwilliaams">listen to music</a>, dance, play guitar, and explore the great outdoors.
                <br><br>
                I live in sunny San Diego and know of only two seasons: "Warm" and "Hot".
                <br><br>
