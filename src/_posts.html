                Since I graduated from UCSD, I have finally had time to remake my personal site, which I just launched! In this post I'll talk about the design and development decisions that I made while building it.

                After a tough two years of finishing my college education at UC San Diego, I have finally graduated with a bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science! Wait...what is cognitive science??

                <p>
                The Android modding community has created a workaround for the bootloop issue common to the LG Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P that leaves the phone endlessly rebooting—effectively useless and dead.

                <p>
                <code>:hover</code> isn't really dead. Its potential and real-world usage has tapered off, but it still has a place in our code. <code>:hover</code> is like the Man In Black—as Miracle Max would say, it just so happens that our friend here is only <em>mostly</em> dead.

                <time>9 June, 2015</time>
                <p>I decided to read through the whole Node.js API and see what useful bits I could find. In order to have an easily-digested overview of the API I wrote these notes on all the modules and some methods I thought would come in handy.</p>
